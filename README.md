# zec-watch

Transparent Zcash transactions are no better than Bitcoin - run a node and you can monitor *everything*

Add this line to your zcash.conf
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:8234

Now run zec-watch and with very few lines of code (written in Perl for Gods sake!!!) you see every transparent transaction on the Zcash network.


Fortunately, SHIELDED ZCASH fixes this by encrypting the amount send, the sending address and the receiving address.

Z2Z Forever !!
Die Taddrs Die !!
